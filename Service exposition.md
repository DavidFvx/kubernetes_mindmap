Services can be exposed in different ways by specifying a `type` in the spec of the Service:
- <span style="color:red">ClusterIP</span> (default) - Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster. This type makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster.
- <span style="color:red">NodePort</span> - Exposes the Service on the same port of each selected Node in the cluster using NAT. Makes a Service accessible from outside the cluster using `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`. Superset of ClusterIP.
- <span style="color:red">LoadBalancer</span> - Creates an external load balancer in the current cloud (if supported) and assigns a fixed, external IP to the Service. Superset of NodePort.
- <span style="color:red">ExternalName</span> - Maps the Service to the contents of the `externalName` field (e.g. `foo.bar.example.com`), by returning a `CNAME` record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. This type requires v1.7 or higher of `kube-dns`, or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher.
